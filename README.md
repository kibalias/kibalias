### Hi there 👋
## Kumusta, Mundo! 🌏

I am Jan!
I am a graduate of Computer Science with keen interest on UI/UX Design and Frontend Development.
✍ Other than programming, I love reading and writing. Other than writing formal and technical documents, I often spend my time formulating stories or indulging into my creativity.
